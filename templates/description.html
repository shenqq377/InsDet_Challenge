<h4>Introduction</h4>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shenqq377/InsDet_Challenge/challenge/templates/objdet-insdet.png" width="50%" height="50%">
<p>Instance Detection (InsDet) is a practically important task in robotics applications, e.g., elderly-assistant robots need to fetch specific items from a cluttered kitchen, micro-fulfillment robots for the retail need to pick items from mixed boxes or shelves. Different from Object Detection (ObjDet) detecting all objects belonging to some predefined classes, InsDet aims to detect specific object instances (defined by some visual examples) from a scene image.</p>
<p>This challenge focuses on the recently introduced InsDet dataset, which is a high-resolution real-world dataset for Instance Detection with Multi-view Instance Capture. Participants in this challenge will be tasked with predicting the bounding boxes for each given instance from testing images. This exciting opportunity allows researchers, students, and data scientists to apply their expertise in computer vision and machine learning to address instance detection problems.</p>
<h4>Dataset</h4>
<p>The dataset contains 100 object instances with multi-view profile images in 24 rotation positions (per 15&deg;), 160 scene images with high-resolution, and 200 pure background images. The scene images are separated into <i>easy</i> and <i>hard</i> cluttered levels. Participants can use the dataset to train and validate their models. You can download the dataset from the <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rIRTtqKJGCTifcqJFSVvFshRb-sB0OzP?usp=sharing">InsDet</a> dataset.</p>
<p>The structure of dataset includes: 
<ul>
<li><b>Objects</b>: raw RGB images(e.g., "images/001.jpg") and segmentation masks(e.g., "masks/001.jpg")</li>
<li><b>Scenes</b>: raw RGB images with 6144x8192 pixels(e.g., "office_001/rgb_000.jpg") and bounding box annotation for objects in PascalVOC format(e.g., "office_001/rgb_000.xml")</li>
<li><b>Background</b>: 200 pure scene images that do not include any given instances from Objects folder</li>
</ul>

</p>
<h4>Development</h4>
<p>The development dataset has the same structure as the Scenes folder, but without the bounding box annotations. Scene images in the development dataset are mostly captured from similar senarios of InsDet dataset.</p>
<h4>Evaluation</h4>
<p>The evaluation dataset has the same structure as the development dataset, but most scene images are captured from different senarios.</p>
