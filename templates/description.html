<h1><font size=10>Welcome to the InsDet Challenge!</font></h1>
<p>Instance Detection (InsDet) is a practically important task in robotics applications, e.g., elderly-assistant robots need to fetch specific item from a cluttered kitchen, micro-fulfillment robots for the retail need to pick items from mixed boxes or shelves. Different from Object Detection (ObjDet) detecting all objects belonging to some predefined classes, InsDet aims to detect specific object instances (defined by some visual examples) from a scene image.</p>
<p>This challenge focuses on the recently introduced InsDet dataset, which consists of high-quality photos of 100 distinc object instances, diverse indoor background and 14 indoor scenes.</p>
