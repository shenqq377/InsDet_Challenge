<h3>Welcome to the InsDet Challenge!</h3>
<h5>Overview</h5>
<p>Instance Detection (InsDet) is a practically important task in robotics applications, e.g., elderly-assistant robots need to fetch specific items from a cluttered kitchen, micro-fulfillment robots for the retail need to pick items from mixed boxes or shelves. Different from Object Detection (ObjDet) detecting all objects belonging to some predefined classes, InsDet aims to detect specific object instances (defined by some visual examples) from a scene image.</p>
<p>This challenge focuses on the recently introduced InsDet dataset, which is a high-resolution real-world dataset for Instance Detection with Multi-view Instance Capture. Participants in this challenge will be tasked with predicting the bounding boxes for each given instance. This exciting opportunity allows researchers, students, and data scientists to apply their expertise in computer vision and machine learning to address instance detection problems.</p>
