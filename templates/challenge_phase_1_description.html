<p>We use testing images in <b>Scenes</b> to help participants test how to upload the JSON file for benchmarking. We further provide python scripts in the <a href="https://github.com/shenqq377/instance_detection_challenge">github repo</a> that walk you through how to preprocess raw data in our dataset and how to evaluate the results w.r.t the evaluation metrics.</p>
